  "body": "The Continuity Activation Tool makes the necessary changes to enable OS X 10.10 Continuity features on compatible hardware. Continuity features activated by this tool include Handoff, Instant Hotspot, and New Airdrop. More info on Continuity is available [here](http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/continuity) (Apple.com).\r\n\r\n## News - 2014.12.14\r\n\r\n**Continuity Activation Tool 2.0 released** : Adds compatibility with Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongles, allowing many Macs from 2008 and later to easily upgrade to Continuity. See the chart below to verify available upgrade options. \r\n\r\nSupport this project by making a PayPal donation today. Thank you!

It firsts looks for previous backups made with the tool, and if it can't find any, kexts from the OS X Recovery Disk are reinstalled. It will only reactivate OS kext signature protection if it is sure that all system kexts installed are signed and valid, to prevent potential boot time issues with 3rd party tools or hardware.\r\n\r\n## Warning\r\n* You should exercise caution when using the Continuity Activation Tool, as it moves around low level files and there's a possibility it could cause problems. Using this tool is at your own risk. Always use the latest version of the tool to avoid issues.\r\n* The tool disables the verification of original Apple drivers in order to work, which lowers the overall system security.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility list\r\nYour Mac might require a hardware upgrade to be able to work with Continuity. See the chart below to understand what your Mac supports, and use the System Diagnostic feature of the Continuity Activation Tool for a compatibility check of your Mac.\r\n\r\n![Compatibility Chart](http://i.imgur.com/UwiFW6M.png)\r\n\r\n**Chart data sources**: Feedback from >150 CAT 2.0 beta testers, feedback reported on this GitHub site, UncleSchnitty's [guide](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=20124161).\r\n\r\n**Pros of using USB BT4.0 dongles**: low cost, easy to install, easy to find on the market\r\n\r\n**Pros of using AirPort Extreme cards**: authentic Apple hardware, better support for Continuity features, doesn't occupy a USB slot\r\n\r\n### Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongles\r\nA few important notes about using CAT with USB Bluetooth 4.0 dongles:\r\n* Bluetooth 4.0 dongles based on the Cambridge Silicon Radio CSR8510 A10 chip (e.g. Inatek Nano) are not compatible with CAT.\r\n* The recommendation is to look for dongles based on the Broadcom BCM20702 chip, which are similar to the ones used by Apple in their Continuity compatible Macs. A few examples: Asus BT400, IOGEAR GBU521, GMYLE, and many others. Compatibility with CSR dongles is not guaranteed.\r\n* Instant Hotspot currently doesn't work reliably when using a dongle. This is a known issue, no workarounds have been identified yet.\r\n* Atheros Wi-Fi AirPort cards will prevent Continuity from working even when adding a Bluetooth 4.0 dongle. The System Diagnostic feature of CAT tells which Wi-Fi brand is active. There are no workarounds and no patch is expected to change this, an AirPort card upgrade is required.\r\n\r\n### AirPort Extreme card upgrades\r\n\r\nThe table below is based on this [guide (forum thread)](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=20124161).

It fixes a bug where the uninstaller could in some cases re-activate OS kext signature protection even if unsigned kexts are installed. Trim Enabler users should not use the uninstallation feature from prior versions to avoid risks of issues at boot-time.\r\n\r\n**v.1.1.1 - 2014.11.12**\r\n* Further improved reliability with systems that can't find utilities due to an irregular PATH ([#9](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/9))\r\n\r\n**v.1.1.0 - 2014.11.11**\r\n\r\n* **New uninstallation feature**: new option to rollback all system changes applied by the tool. It firsts looks for previous backups made with the tool, and if it can't find any, kexts from the OS X Recovery Disk are used. It will only reactivate OS kext signature protection if it is sure that all system kexts installed are signed. The uninstallation can be also be called from the command line.

Previous behavior was to silently overwrite.\r\n* Removed the 13\" MacBook Pro 2010 from the compatibility list ([#28](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/28), pull [#29](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/pull/29))\r\n* Minor optimisations\r\n\r\n\r\n**v.1.0.1 -  2014.10.24**\r\n\r\n* Fixed a boot arguments overwriting bug, that could lead to a system failure in specific cases ([#1](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/1), [#15](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/15))\r\n* Fixed a kext-dev-mode bug that prevented the OS to disable its drivers protection\r\n* Fixed the strings utility presence check when the script is run from the command line\r\n* Added a disk reparation step at the start of the patching procedure, lowering failure risks on disks with permissions issues\r\n* Added a verification that sudo is still active before patching\r\n\r\n**v.1.0.0 - 2014.10.23**\r\n\r\n* Initial release\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n* To the >150 CAT 2.0 beta testers\r\n* Skvo\r\n* toleda\r\n* Lem3ssie (LAUTRU Mehdi)\r\n* UncleSchnitty\r\n* TealShark\r\n* Manic Harmonic\r\n* rob3r7o\r\n\r\nTool created and maintained by [David Dudok de Wit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviddudokdewit) (dokterdok)",
